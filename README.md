All solutions have been tested against TopCoder's system tests and have passed
all test cases. If you find a mistake, please email me at
mtcliatt@valdosta.edu.

Feel free to use any of my code for any reason.

Note the coding style may differ from file to file depending on when I coded
the solution. Earlier solutions may follow the style of having every bracket
on a new line while later solutions will follow the KnR bracket style.
